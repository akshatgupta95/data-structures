Linked List (Singly Linked List)
  - Insert operation
  - Delete operation
  - Swapping Algorithm

Trie (A space efficient data storage structure)
  - Store words
  - Efficiently find if specified word exists

LPM (Longest Prefix Matching using a Trie Data Structure)
  - Used in Network Routing for searching for correct Destination Address for incoming Data Packets in routers
  - Implemented here using a simple Word Search Example
  - Even if exact word does not exist in the Trie, it return the one that is closest (criteria) to the searched word
